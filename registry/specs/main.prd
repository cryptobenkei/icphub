1. First we deploy the canister
2. Then we set an admin.
- From that moment only admins can add/remove admins or any other role.
- Admins can also withdraw ICP token from the contract

3. The admin creates a new season. Only admin.
4. The admin activates a season.
- From this moemnt users can buy a name in the season with Ã±the season limitations.

5. The user that has control (owner) of the name can 
- Edit the settings. It's the metadata document.
- Edit the markdown document
- Edit the DID document.
- Only the owner can call these functions
- We save the timestamp so we can read all the names created after a timestamp with just one call.
- Every time we update a document we also save a new timestamp for the document. This way we can read all the documents updated after a timestamp.

6. Only The admin can upgrade the contract.
- To updgrade a contract we make changes to the motoko code.
- Then we create a migration functions
- Then we can migrate and decide the new version of the contract (minor, major or patch).
